Have you ever thought to yourself "Man, i wish i had an emergency crash button for my gameserver"?

Boy do i have the really bad python project for you!

this is a script for a button that crashes a minecraft server, but the .env can be filled to make it do other things

just edit the .env with details

press the first button 3 times until all the lamps are lit and then press the second one to execute a command remotely

i won't explain more.

## Requirements

- python-dotenv
- paramiko
- python3
